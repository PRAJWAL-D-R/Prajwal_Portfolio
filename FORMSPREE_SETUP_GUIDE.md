**Email Subject:** Portfolio Contact: [Sender's Name]

**Email Content:**
```
Name: John Doe
Email: john@example.com
Message: Hi, I'm interested in working with you...

Reply-To: john@example.com
```

## âœ¨ Features

- **Direct delivery** to your inbox
- **No API keys** required
- **Free tier**: 50 submissions/month
- **Spam protection** built-in
- **Reply-to** functionality
- **Fallback** to mailto if service fails

## ðŸ”§ Current Status

The form is already configured with a temporary Formspree endpoint. To make it work with your email:

1. **Sign up at Formspree.io**
2. **Create a form**
3. **Replace the URL** in the code with your form URL
4. **Test the form**

## ðŸŽ¯ Alternative: Use Current Setup

The current setup will:
1. **Try Formspree** first (may work with temporary endpoint)
2. **Fallback to mailto** if Formspree fails
3. **Always work** - users can always send emails

This ensures your contact form always works, even without setup!
